Welcome to the Trolley Test.
Here, we will ask you 3 questions regarding your moral compass.
Are you ready? Are you prepared?



Let's begin.
There is a runaway trolley barreling down the tracks.
On the tracks are 5 people unable to move. You are next to a lever.
If you pull, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. 
However, you notice there is another person on the other track.


What do you do?



Oh so you're going to sit back and do nothing?
I guess you're right, the more people that die the better…


Oh… You’re going to kill someone! This isn’t how I thought I was going to start my day… I hope that person’s family and friends will forgive you.
